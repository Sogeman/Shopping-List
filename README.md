# Shopping-List
simple shopping list, since I didn't want to pay for more databases on my hoster, I decided to use local storage.

1 line of php for the Date at the top. Rest is Jquery/JS and Bootstrap

Todo (maybe at some point): change the delete button for each item to clicking on that item to mark it done
